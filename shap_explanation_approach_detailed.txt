SHAP-Based Explanation for Human-Robot Intent: 'approach'

The most influential features on this prediction were:

- 'force' = 9.134 → decreased confidence in predicting 'approach'
- 'x' = 0.442 → increased confidence in predicting 'approach'
- 'z' = 0.535 → increased confidence in predicting 'approach'

Additional motion dynamics:

- 'vx' = -0.000 → high impact (SHAP = -0.348)
- 'vy' = 0.000 → high impact (SHAP = -0.348)
- 'vz' = 0.000 → high impact (SHAP = 0.140)
